### About
In a future century where a 70-hour workweek is the norm, people all over the globe are beginning to feel the generational effects of stress resulting in social isolation. Loneliness, once conceived of by the public as a simple unfortunate nuisance, is now the silent killer of many through deterioration of mental health.

In order to survive this “loneliness epidemic,” humanity (refusing to alter its social structure) turns to biotechnological innovations to solve its problems. By inserting a small sample of modified fungal tissue into participants’ heads, one company has the solution: The Interface, a global network of human minds, made possible by combining the capabilities of the human mind with that of vast underground fungal networks. By integrating oneself with The Interface, one will never be alone again; their thoughts, desires, and needs are inherently shared with their peers. 

### Overview

The game consists of multiple decisions that one must make in terms of how the company that owns The Interface will function. There are ethical and economical dilemmas involved in this decision-making. The user’s decisions affect both public opinion (opinion that the aforementioned populations have of the company) as well as the amount of the world’s overall population that has integrated into The Interface. The choices the player makes and the scores they affect will decide which of the six possible endings they get at the end of the game.
