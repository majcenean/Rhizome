		<p>In a future century where a 70-hour workweek is the norm, people all over the globe are beginning to feel the generational effects of stress resulting in social isolation. Loneliness, once conceived of by the public as a simple unfortunate nuisance, is now the silent killer of many through deterioration of mental health.</p>
		<p>In order to survive this “loneliness epidemic,” humanity (refusing to alter its social structure) turns to biotechnological innovations to solve its problems. By inserting a small sample of modified fungal tissue into participants’ heads, one company has the solution: The Interface, a global network of human minds, made possible by combining the capabilities of the human mind with that of vast underground fungal networks. By integrating oneself with The Interface, one will never be alone again; their thoughts, desires, and needs are inherently shared with their peers.</p>
		<p>This technology has great meaning to social recluses and the lonely all over the world, as it would end their suffering alone. Technology enthusiasts are in excitement over the brand as it represents human innovation and dominion over primeval nature. Governments want to regulate the new technology, get their hands on it to provide to their citizens, and profit from it as well. Mental health professionals who have studied the loneliness epidemic closely are fascinated by the promises it makes. Skeptics of the technology see it as an unnecessary solution where a natural one, like readjusting how society functions, could work better.</p>
